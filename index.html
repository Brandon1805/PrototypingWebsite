<h2>Our company</h2>
		<p>
		BactoView is a private company headquartered in the Imperial College Advanced Hackspace in white City, London. The company was founded in 2018 as part 
		of an Imperial Horizons module with the goal of developing affordable and effective automated devices for the monitoring of cell populations. 
</p>
<p>
		Bactoview currently has 4 employees, all of whom were founding members of the company. 
		The company draws on their expertise in multiple disciplines including bioengineering, materials science and chemical engineering to deliver high quality products.
		</p><BR>
	<h2>Our mission</h2>
<p>
		Quantitative and data driven approaches have come to dominate modern biology. Dubbed biology 2.0, this revolution in the way research is done in biology has far reaching 
		implications on the tools used by scientists. One such implication is the trend towards the automation of wet lab tasks. 
		However, despite massive progress in wet lab automation, there remains a lack of affordable and automated cell density measuring products available on the market.
</p>
<p>The tracking of bacterial cell culture density is crucial for several experiments. One example is protein induction experiments, where cell density is measured regularly as 
protein expression is optimal when it is induced at a specific phase of the population growth cycle. Unfortunately, for many smaller labs the only affordable option for monitoring cell density is manual measurement using a spectrophotometer. 
This normally involves researchers returning to a set up regularly to make measurements, which requires significant time and effort.
</p>
<p>To overcome this problem BactoView is developing an automated bacterial monitoring platform that can be used to monitor the cell density of flask cultures. Through our platform, 
we hope to provide researchers improved access to data while 
reducing the labour cost of cell monitoring experiments.
