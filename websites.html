		In the first subsection, the criteria for a good website is explored. The second and third 
		subsections include discussions on accessibility in web design and GDPR respectively. These

<h2>Criteria for a good website</h2>
         <h5>1.Intuitive Navigation</h5>
		<p>
		Poor navigation systems reduces the effectiveness with which users can interact with the website. Poor navigation could be a result of needing multiple links to access different parts of the website. 
		In our website, links to various parts of the website are limited to the navigation bar. This enables the user to move between the different parts seamlessly. 
		A further reason for poor navigation stems from cluttered menus and content – we have thus opted to maintain a simple website with ample white space to give users ‘breathing room’.
		</p>
		<h5>2. Good Aesthetics</h5>
		<p>
		A web site that looks good will be more attractive to users. However, aesthetics is not just about making things look nice. 
		Aesthetics is also important in determining how the sender is perceived. It must match its intended purpose as well as suit the target audience. 
		We have opted for a simple, professional look with our website to suit our image as a budding new business. 
		Our needs would be different to say an entertainment website, where a more youthful, energetic image is sought. 
		Images are used sparingly but effectively to maximize their impact. 
		</p>
		<h5>3. Clear communication</h5>
		<p>
		Content clarity has an important impact on user interaction. Things must be clearly marked and whenever possible, explicitly explained to ensure successful communication. 
		Explanations must be clear and concise to ensure that communication with the user remains unambiguous. 
		For our website, this is especially important in the product section, as complex engineering and scientific concepts must be explained succinctly for the user to understand the purpose of the website.  
		The product price and features must be explicitly stated such that the user has a good sense on whether the product fulfils their requirements. 
		</p>
		<h5>4. Mindful of technical considerations</h5>
		<p>
		There are multiple technical considerations that must be considered by a website designer. First is the loading time of the website. User engagement would be less pleasant if website loading times are excessively long. 
		3mb per page is a rough limit for how much content is acceptable per page.  A further technical consideration is that the website must be able to load in different browsers, including mobile browsers.
		</p><BR>
		
	<h2>Accessibility</h2>
<p>
		Accessibility is a design principle whereby the needs of minority groups are considered when building the website. 
		‘Minority groups’ here is loosely defined. Often, it is used to refer to disabled groups. 
		However, it may also refer to people from minority races or nationalities as well as people from lower socio-economic backgrounds. 
		Accessibility is about ensuring that such users are still able to experience the web site and interact with it. 
</p>
<p>The following steps will help ensure that the website remains accessible:</p>
<h5>1.Clear and coherent typography</h5>
		<p>
		Maintain a large font size and consistent hierarchy. Large font sizes enable all users to read content clearly. This is especially important for visually impaired users. 
		</p>
		<h5>2. Text presentation </h5>
		<p>
		Large blocks of text should be avoided as these make it difficult for users to read, which especially disadvantages the visually impaired. To prevent this, text should be broken down into smaller paragraphs. 
		</p>
		<h5>3. Use of alt text</h5>
		<p>
		Visually impaired users use software to read out the contents on their screen to them. For this, alt text allows them to understand the contents of an image without seeing the image. 
		This allows them to contextualize the image within their experience of the website. 
		</p>
		<h5>4. Minimally Operable</h5>
		<p>
		To be accessible to users with limited motor function, the website must be operable without complex manoeuvres. Ideally, the website should be operable without a mouse. 
		However, where this not possible the user should be able to interact with the computer using only very simple mouse movements. 
		</p>
		<h5>5. Maintain a good colour contrast</h5>
		<p>
		Good colour contrast is necessary to ensure that text is readable. There is a technical standard governing this known as contrast rating. 
		A website achieves the highest possible score for accessibility if it achieves a 7:1 contrast rating.  
		</p>
		<h5>6. Use simple English for content </h5>
		<p>
		Some users may not have perfect command over the English language, either because they speak it as a non-native language or because they come from less educated backgrounds. 
		To ensure that the website remains accessible to them, jargon and inaccessible terms must be avoided. Furthermore, simple sentence structures should be used. 
		</p>
		<h5>7. Usable in all browsers and devices </h5>
		<p>
		Socio economic status may limit users’ ability to switch between platforms. Successful interaction with users is dependent on the ability of the website to function properly in the platform being used by a user. 
		Hence the website must show properly across all websites. 
		</p>
		<BR>

		<h2>GDPR</h2>
<p>
		The GDPR (General Data Protection and Regulation) was a legal bill passed by the European Union effective from the 25th of May 2018. The bill regulates various aspects of data collection and storage. It is the successor to the 1995 Data Protection Directive and was drafted to mitigate its shortcomings. 
</p>
<p>
The GDPR has a few major effects. EU citizens were granted more power over their personal data collected by companies. The law permits them to request a copy of their personal data as well as request that any data about them being held be deleted.
</p>
<p>
In addition to increasing the rights of users, GDPR also imposes a few rules on how companies may collect and store data. Companies must ask for consent before collecting user data. Tick boxes requesting consent for the collection of personal data must be opt-in, that is, the must be unticked by default, and the user should be able to withdraw consent at any time.  Companies must report any data breaches to the relevant authorities within 72 hours. The penalty for non-compliance with this rule is a fine that may be up to  ‎€20 million or 4% of annual profit.
