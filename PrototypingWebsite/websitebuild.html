        <p> In this section I discuss the various tools used to build the website. This includes the primary tool used for 
		editing the html and CSS code, notepad++. However, it also includes other utilities that were useful in, for example, editing images and
		managing code.

<h2>Notepad++</h2>
		<p>
		Notepad++ is a software used to edit text files. It functions similarly to notepad, but it has been optimized for the editing of code. 
		For html files, it highlights the different colours of the html tags, making it easy to track the function of each block of code. This
		gives it a clear advantage over notepad. However, besides notepad++ many programs have a similar functionality, and it would be difficult to justify choosing 
		one over the other over technical merits alone. I have personally chosen notepad++ over similar software simply because I am more familiar with it. 
		
</p>
	<h2>GitHub</h2>
<p>
		GitHub is useful for managing my code. I work over multiple devices, and Github is a way of ensuring that I have access to my code whenever I require. 
		Compared to facilities like onedrive or google drive, it  is optimized for the cloud based storage of coding projects, and is equipped with software-specific 
		services such as version managers. The Github pages feature is very useful, as it enables my website to be hosted without a domain, allowing other users to 
		view it without having the html files on hand. Looking beyond personal gains, using GitHub encourages community, allowing other users to access and  
		learn from the code.     
</p>
		<h2>LunaPic</h2>
<p>
		LunaPic is a web-based image editing service. I used it to blend a dark blue background with a few images to yield the banners above (the only exception is the banner
		used for the 'about us' and 'team' pages, which was obtained from the internet). In addition to being free, blending the images in Lunapic was also very simple and required 
		no training, as opposed to using softwares like GIMP. 
</p>
		<h2>Paint</h2>
<p>
		Paint was used to touch up the output from LunaPic. Only very simple things needed to be done - such as resizing images and filling in missing pixels,
		and so a more complex image editing software was not required. 
</p>
		<h2>Shutterstock</h2>
<p>
		Shutterstock is a useful website from which I obtained images for the banner. The shutterstock licence allows me to use the images for free in a website,
		and hence the images used are compliant with copyright law.
</p>
		<h2>W3schools</h2>
<p>
		W3schools is a website that offers information on coding for web design. I found it helpful in designing certain elements of the website, especially 
		the accordion found in the 'technology' section. It also provided useful information on creating new CSS classes and editing those in the template.
